# `SearchEverywhere` TODO

Only GUI-related TODOs are listed here. For non-GUI related TODOs like
new matchers or performance improvements, see
[orient TODO](https://github.com/ccPlus/orient/docs/TODO.md).  
A *grand update* idea is also documented there.

- [] Add a system tray icon
- [] Hotkey to wake up from the tray icon
- [] Attempt to port the app to Android
    > Releasing it is another set of task
- [] Disable action nodes for security
    > May be done on `orient` side though
- [] Elegantly handle backquotes in inputs
    > Currently, to prevent expression injection, a backquote in every
    > input panel would be ruthlessly rejected
- [] Translate the "previewer" part
    > Hard due to modularization
